The ranking system uses an adjusted efficiency margin framework similar to other popular college basketball websites (KenPom, Barttorvik, etc) to calculate efficiency ratings for women's basketball. 

### Game Ratings

For each game, final scores are converted to points per 100 possessions for each team to control for pace. Then, scores are adjusted to remove home court advantage, which works out to about 3.9 points per 100 possessions â€” a slightly lower value than for men's NCAA basketball. Finally, each team's offensive and defensive performance is compared to their opponent's season-long performance on that side of the ball in all games excluding the current game. For example, if Virginia scores 110 points per 100 possessions against Duke's defense, and Duke's defense allows 90 points per 100 possessions in all other games that season, Virginia receives an efficiency rating of +20. 

### Season Ratings

To calculate season ratings, each team's average offensive and defensive efficiency margin over the course of the season is calculated. Net rating is the difference between a team's offensive and defensive ratings. For example, a team with an efficiency rating 10 points above average on each side of the ball receives a net rating of +20.
